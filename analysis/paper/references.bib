  abstract = {As more and more systems are connected, a large benefit is found in being able to find and predict problems in the monitored process. By analyzing the data in real time, feedback can be generated to the operators or the process allowing the process to correct itself. This thesis implements and evaluates three CUDA GPU implementations of the principal component analysis used for dimensionality reduction of multivariate data sets running in real time to explore the trade-offs of the algorithm implementations in terms of speed, energy and accuracy. The GPU implementations are compared to reference implementations on the CPU. The study finds that the covariance based method is the fastest of the implementations for the tested configurations, but the iterative NIPALS implementation has some interesting optimization opportunities that are explored. For large enough data sets, speedup compared to the 8 virtual core CPU of around 100 is obtained for the GPU implementations, making the GPU implementations an option to investigate for problems requiring real time computation of principal components.},

Their properties are compared with those of natural outcrops, i.e. the Wommersom and Tienen quartzite and a third unknown variety. Therefore, a detailed petrographical and geochemical study is performed by means of optical microscopy, point counting, image analysis, scanning electron microscopy, hot-cathodoluminescence microscopy, inductively coupled plasma – optical emission spectrometry and portable X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. It is shown that the geological samples of the sedimentary quartzite varieties can be distinguished based on their texture and composition. The results of the grain size distribution indicate that there is a clear contrast between the fine-grained Wommersom quartzite versus the much coarser-grained Tienen quartzite. On the other hand, the concentrations of the chemical elements zirconium, titanium and iron show a difference between the three quartzite varieties, with the aid of discriminant function analysis. These criteria are applied to a number of archaeological artefacts showing that most of the investigated samples are composed of the fine-grained Wommersom quartzite. The provenance of the more coarser-grained artefacts is still unknown.},

  abstract = {The garnet-biotite-sillimanite anatectic xenoliths in the Neogene dacite dome of El Joyazo (also called Cerro de Hoyazo, SE Spain) contain four types of graphite (I to IV), distinguished on the basis of grain size and texture. Structural characterization of graphite by Laser Raman spectroscopy (LRS) shows systematic differences in the degree of ordering among the four types: only type III is fully consistent with the granulite-facies conditions reached by the xenoliths during partial melting, the others indicate metamorphic temperatures covering amphibolite-facies conditions, with only a few examples of granulite-grade crystallinity. All graphite crystallized before or during the anatectic event, indicating that a large fraction of the graphite did not equilibrate at peak temperatures. The mm-scale coexistence of different types and degrees of ordering in the graphite suggests different origins, i.e. of biogenic derivation and “fluid-deposited”, and is explained in terms of fluid-melt-graphite interaction during the anatectic event. Disequilibrium behaviour during high-temperature metamorphism and anatexis is typical of types I, II and particularly of IV, and is attributed to sluggish kinetics of solid-state graphitization, mainly owing to the limited time of the process and carbon saturation of the intergranular fluid. The coexisting, well-ordered type III graphite is the product of melting in the presence of a graphite-saturated fluid, a process that would account for the deposition of new graphite. The LRS results, together with petrologic observations, suggest that it is possible that high melt fractions can be generated by fluid-present melting of a metasedimentary protolith also in a closed system. Although this contradicts the commonly accepted hypothesis that, due to limited rock porosities, extensive fluid-present melting is precluded unless infiltration occurs, it is a possible end-member model in anatectic settings characterized by rapid heating rates and low-grade source rocks.},

  abstract = {The temperature dependence of the room pressure Raman spectra of the GeO2 (hexagonal and tetragonal) and SiO2 (quartz, coesite, and stishovite) polymorphs is presented. Several transformations upon heating are reported: α‐β quartz, coesite‐cristobalite, stishovite‐silica glass (with Si in four‐fold coordination). For all the compounds, Raman frequencies decrease linearly with temperature and the measured shifts are used in conjunction with available high‐pressure Raman data to calculate for each compound intrinsic mode anharmonicity through the parameter ai=(∂lnVi/∂T)v. In quartz the modes related to the α‐β transition (128 and 207 cm−1 modes) are highly anharmonic (ai=−20×10−5 K−11). In coesite many bands are unaffected by temperature and only two modes (77 and 116 cm−1) show significant anharmonic behaviour. Tetragonal GeO2 and stishovite behave similarly under temperature. Vibrational modeling of the specific heat and entropy, including anharmonic corrections deduced from the ai parameters, are presented and compared to available calorimetric measurements. For the GeO2 polymorphs the agreement between calculated and measured values is within 1–3\% in the temperature range 100 to 1500 K. For quartz the agreement is similar over the range 50–850 K. For coesite and stishovite the models reproduce existing low temperature measurements. High‐temperature values of Cp and entropy are proposed for coesite and stishovite.}

  abstract = {Formal technologies and intensified reduction are often seen as responses to increased mobility and low abundance of lithic raw material of good flakeability and controllability. In this paper, we discuss an alternative explanation to this hypothesis using the change in tool raw material experienced by flint-using pioneers, as they had to go from a formal blade technology to a simple flake technology as they settled in Scandinavia. The region is dominated by quartz, and we use use-wear data as a means to evaluate the role of this type of raw material compared to the use profile of flint assemblages in the home territories of the pioneers. Although the technology changed through simplification and loss of formal production rules, due to the low workability of quartz, we conclude that changes in the foraging range into areas of different quality tool raw materials does not need formalization of the technology. The quartz in our sample was produced with a simple platform/bipolar technology and used for a wide variety of activities in every aspect comparable to the range of uses identified in the contemporaneous blade assemblages based on flint. Instead of formalization of the lithic technology to cope with different quality raw materials, it was diversified and simplified. The organisational dimensions and design criteria of the bone technology, whereby simple flakes were used as insets in slotted tools, did not have to change in this process.},

  abstract = {Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is a graphene-like material that exhibits high productivity for a wide range of industrial applications. To promote the application of rGO, it is important to not only produce high-quality rGO but also precisely evaluate the output. The intensity ratio of the D to G band in the Raman scattering is commonly used to assess the defect density of the carbon materials; however, this ratio is limited to evaluate the reduction degree of rGO because of the ambiguity arising from the superposition of the bands. In this study, we investigate the relationship between the intensity ratio of D* to G band and the reduction of graphene oxide (GO) to evaluate the degree of reduction of rGO. The spectral analysis of GO and rGO, along with systematic research of the thermally reduced GO synthesized via thermal treatment (100–900 °C) revealed a strong linkage between the D*/G intensity ratio and the C/O atomic ratio. The atomic vibrational relationships were elucidated by the assignment of the D* band, based on the density functional perturbation theory calculations. These findings explain the atomic vibrational properties of rGO and provide an indicator of the quality of rGO to optimize its performance for applications.},

  abstract = {Several isolated studies have tried to understand quartzite from an archaeological perspective by applying two different methodological approaches. The first one is based on non-destructive characterisation, aiming to understand human procurement and management of quartzite, without solid geoarchaeological criteria. The second characterised the material from archaeological sites using only petrographic or geochemical perspectives of a limited sample. Currently, both perspectives are unconnected, creating a methodological gap that needs to be solved to study the procurement and management of quartzite in greater depth. The present study, mainly methodological, will explore the gap between petrographic analysis and non-destructive characterisation. Doing so, we could fill this vacuum of information and generate a solid geoarchaeological basis to characterise not only a sample but complete assemblages. To this end, we analyse the lithic assemblages at El Arteu and El Habario, two Middle-Palaeolithic sites in the Cantabrian Region, northern Spain. We summarise the main results derived from petrographic analysis, but especially we will focus on non-destructive criteria to characterise the lithic surfaces of archaeological quartzite using stereoscope microscopy. This process allows us to understand the complete assemblage but also, through technological characterisation, understand the management of different quartzite petrogenetic types in both sites.}

  abstract = {To provide a new reconstruction of the deglaciation of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet, in the form of calendar-year time-slices, which are particularly useful for ice sheet modelling, we have compiled and synthesized published geomorphological data for eskers, ice-marginal formations, lineations, marginal meltwater channels, striae, ice-dammed lakes, and geochronological data from radiocarbon, varve, optically-stimulated luminescence, and cosmogenic nuclide dating. This is summarized as a deglaciation map of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet with isochrons marking every 1000 years between 22 and 13~cal~kyr BP and every hundred years between 11.6 and final ice decay after 9.7~cal~kyr BP. Deglaciation patterns vary across the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet domain, reflecting differences in climatic and geomorphic settings as well as ice sheet basal thermal conditions and terrestrial versus marine margins. For example, the ice sheet margin in the high-precipitation coastal setting of the western sector responded sensitively to climatic variations leaving a detailed record of prominent moraines and other ice-marginal deposits in many fjords and coastal valleys. Retreat rates across the southern sector differed between slow retreat of the terrestrial margin in western and southern Sweden and rapid retreat of the calving ice margin in the Baltic Basin. Our reconstruction is consistent with much of the published research. However, the synthesis of a large amount of existing and new data support refined reconstructions in some areas. For example, the LGM extent of the ice sheet in northwestern Russia was located far east and it occurred at a later time than the rest of the ice sheet, at around 17–15~cal~kyr BP. We also propose a slightly different chronology of moraine formation over southern Sweden based on improved correlations of moraine segments using new LiDAR data and tying the timing of moraine formation to Greenland ice core cold stages. Retreat rates vary by as much as an order of magnitude in different sectors of the ice sheet, with the lowest rates on the high-elevation and maritime Norwegian margin. Retreat rates compared to the climatic information provided by the Greenland ice core record show a general correspondence between retreat rate and climatic forcing, although a close match between retreat rate and climate is unlikely because of other controls, such as topography and marine versus terrestrial margins. Overall, the time slice reconstructions of Fennoscandian Ice Sheet deglaciation from 22 to 9.7~cal~kyr BP provide an important dataset for understanding the contexts that underpin spatial and temporal patterns in retreat of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet, and are an important resource for testing and refining ice sheet models.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Despite its worldwide use as a stone tool raw material, quartz is known to be a difficult material for archaeologists. The main reason for this is the tendency of quartz flakes to fragment during detachment, which complicates the use of traditional lithic analyses. In this article we present an experimental study of quartz flake fragmentation. We evaluate the method called fracture analysis that has been developed and used explicitly for the study of quartz assemblages. The method assumes high predictability of quartz flake fragmentation, but our experiments show that there is significant variation in fragmentation that fracture analysis does not take into account. Our results indicate that this variation is partly explained by indenter hardness, the relative thickness of the detached flake, as well as individual knapper-related factors. These results undermine the applicability of quartz fracture analysis in its current form. In addition, we discuss the effects of flake fragmentation...},

  abstract = {Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and carbon nanofibers (CNF) were created using chemical vapor deposition at growth temperatures between 500 and 750°C, which have increasing crystallinity with increasing growth temperature. We used Raman spectroscopy to analyze the samples. The intensity ratios compared to the G-band, and full-width at half-maximum, of all observable Raman bands in both the first and second-order region were investigated. Good match was observed for the defect related bands of the MWCNT samples and data found in the literature. Several second-order bands display a strong dependency to growth temperature. Similar growth temperature (and thus defect) dependencies were found between several first and second-order bands, which might aid in determining the physical causes of these bands. CNF show much weaker Raman features due to their low crystallinity, making them more difficult to analyse. The results of this work are used to give recommendations on how to investigate MWCNT and CNF crystallinity using Raman spectroscopy. Finally, we demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy can be used to distinguish between the MWCNT root and tip growth mechanism.}
