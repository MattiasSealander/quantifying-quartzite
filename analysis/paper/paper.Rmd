# Introduction

In European archaeology provenience studies and petrographic characterization has for some time favoured flint and obsidian over other geological materials [@prieto_etal20 p.32]. However, in regions where local flint and obsidian sources are non-existent other materials have taken on the dominant role. In Northern Fennoscandia these include quartz, quartzite and slate  [@baudou78; @rankama_etal06; @olausson_etal12], and while both quartz and quartzite technology have been the target of a number of studies over the years there have been less development in the petrographic characterization and provenience studies of these same materials [@broadbent79; @callahan_etal92; @knutsson_etal16; @tallavaara_etal10].

One reason for the lack of methodological development could be the geological background of the region and the abundance of moraine formations [@bargel03; @stephens_bergmanweihed20; @stroeven_etal16]. The degree to which geological materials have been mixed and transported means that considerable effort is needed in order to reconstruct the events that have formed the modern day landscape. Both quartz and quartzite could potentially have been sourced by local prehistoric groups from exposed veins in the bedrock, or as loose rocks and pebbles in the numerous moraine formations [@rankama_etal06]. Due to this ambigous nature of availability of raw materials it is difficult to model sourcing strategies for groups that were based within this region. 
Prieto et al. [-@prieto_etal19 p.15; -@prieto_etal20 p.32] notes that ‘quartzite’ represents a somewhat ambiguous term in archaeology, where it is often used interchangeably between sedimentary orthoquartzite and metamorphic quartzite. This issue has been discussed in geology as well [@howard05], and the definition hence varies somewhat between authors. Visual characterization of quartzite on a megascopic level is typically unreliable, and microscopic analysis is recommended for identification of subtypes based on metamorphic grade, but Howard  also emphasises the need for field-based methodologies. 

In recent years there has been increased development of petrographic characterization of quartzite using destructive methods [e.g. @blomme_etal12; @cnudde_etal12; @dalpra_pitblado16; @prieto_etal19; @prieto_etal20]. These have had success in distinguishing between different groups of quartzite types, allowing for more meaningful studies into quartzite-based resource management strategies. In archaeology there are times, however, when destructive techniques simply are not applicable. Artefact collections (museum, private, etc.) represent a valuable resource, as well as one of the easier ways of gaining access to large datasets with some geographical distribution. While destructive methods may prohibit access to such material there are still non-destructive methods that can generate valuable information. The use of spectroscopy in petrographic characterization is not new, but it is often applied in conjunction with thin-section analysis [e.g. @blomme_etal12; @prieto_etal20]. A major advantage of spectroscopy, however, is that it is both non-destructive and feature fast measurements, making it an attractive alternative for field-based screening purposes. While X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) is the go-to spectroscopic technique for petrographic characterization [@shackley11; @tykot03], due to its capability of quantifying the elemental content of a material, there are other instrumentations that may provide a deeper insight into the structural properties. Near Infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) goes almost as far back as the XRF [@hunt77], and there is an impressive body of work dedicated to the fingerprinting of geological materials [@linderholm_geladi14a; @linderholm_geladi14b; @sciuto19]. The same can be said for Raman spectroscopy, which also has been applied extensively in the Cultural Heritage sector and the analysis of artwork and manuscripts [@vandenabeele12].   

In the current study a dataset of quartzite artefacts from museum collections in Västerbotten, Sweden, have been analysed using the three above mentioned spectroscopic instrumentations (NIRS, Raman, XRF). They all provide different information on the structure and composition of the material and will thus be evaluated in regards to the different features they record in the quartz/quartzite. This will be achieved via Principal Component Analysis (PCA) where the observed groupings of the material will be related to the spectral features. Lastly, the potential for combining the results of the analyses in order to study joint relations will be discussed.

The current study is based on spectroscopic surface measurements on quartzite points found within the County of Västerbotten, Sweden. A dataset of `r length(sample_uniq)` points, point fragments and preforms made from quartz/quartzite material stored at the collections at Västerbotten and Skellefteå museums were analysed using three different spectroscopic instrumentations (Appendix XX). The colour of the material has a mainly black (N1-N3), grey or white (N9) hue, as well as opaque and almost translucent material with a beige tint. The colour of the material has been classified both according to the munsell system, as well as sorted into general categories of hue (*dark* ~ N1-N4, *light* ~ N5-N8, *translucent*, *white* ~ N9). A number of these points have, according to prior classifications, been worked using bifacial technology. While there currently is no local chronology available for this artefact type in the North Swedish region, previous research suggest they were in use during the 4 000 – 2 000 BP period [@forsberg85; @forsberg89; @mjaerum12]. Similarly, early studies of raw material use at sites dating to this period seems to indicate an increase in the use of quartzite compared to previous periods [@baudou78]. 

A large portion of the collections stored at North Swedish museums were recovered from excavations and surveys performed in conjunction with the river regulations during the 1940s – 1980s [@biornstad06; @janson_hvarfner60], as well as subsequent follow-up survey projects [e.g. @andersson15]. This has likely had a contributing factor to the distribution pattern of the artefacts observed in fig. \@ref(fig:distribution-map) as the known sites with finds of points and preforms are concentrated around the parishes of Dorotea, Lycksele, Vilhelmina and Tärnaby. This can be seen more clearly in fig. \@ref(fig:distribution-by-parish) with the four parishes accounting for almost ¾ of the total no. of samples. 

Västerbotten museum have come far in their digitization effort, making large portions of their collections searchable. Based on a query of all points labelled as *quartz*, *brecciated quartz* or *quartzite* a list was generated from their database. Sampling of this pool of artefacts was not random, and based on geographical distribution, in an effort to include as many artefacts as possible from areas with few finds available, such as along the Vindel river. None of these were from the northernmost Skellefte river, however, and thus a selection of 5 artefacts each from three well-known sites stored at the collections of Skellefte museum were included. This resulted in a total dataset of `r length(tot_uniq)` artefacts, and after documentation and looking up missing information, `r length(sample_uniq)` of these were determined to be either points or preforms made from quartz/quartzite material.

While parts of the collections at Västerbotten museum have been petrographically analysed by a geologist [@biornstad68; @ahman67], at this point it is difficult to say with any certainty how many (if any) of the artefacts in the current dataset were among these. It is fair to assume that the vast majority have been classified visually based on megascopic features according to a “standard” archaeological nomenclature. In the dataset the four main types of registered materials are: quartz, quartzite, brecciated quartz, and brecciated quartzite ^[Original Swedish terms are *brecciekvarts*/*brecciekvartsit* , the latter possibly a spelling mistake]. Those that had no prior material classification registered were sorted into either the quartz or quartzite category. The reason for including ‘quartz’ in the study is in order to test whether it is possible to separate quartz from quartzite using these methods, as well as a way to account for potential mistakes in the original classification.

Another reason for keeping a *quartz* category is the group referred to as *brecciated quartz*. In a petrographic study of the artefacts recovered along the Ume river valley Åhman (1967:8) briefly touches upon the definition of *brecciated quartz*, also referring to it as a *mylonite quartz*. Åhman describes the material as having formed from a quartz vein which has fractured due to movements in the mountain massives and recrystallized via pressure. While the translucent material may give the impression of an unusually pure quartzite, Åhman states that the thin-section analysis reveals the fragmented configuration of quartz. *Brecciated quartz* is a somewhat common term used in North Swedish archaeology, and has typically been used to identify a certain translucent type of fine-grained, quartz-rich material [e.g. @holm91].

# Methods

 \linebreak
 \linebreak
All measurements were performed at the Environmental Archaeology Lab at Umeå University using three different instrumentations; NIRS, Raman scattering, and XRF. The analysis was conducted in a dark room in order to minimize light pollution, with the main light sources in the room being the computer screens. Each artefact was measured twice on different sides, with additional measurements in cases where sampling was difficult. The only exception to this was the XRF, where due to time constraints one measurement was collected as a rule apart from a few exceptions. This lowers the statistical reliability of the XRF analysis and inferences of the results should be evaluated with this in mind. The size of the dataset alleviates some of these issues, as for the larger sites there are multiple objects that may be of the same material, however, for the smaller sites there still remains some uncertainties.  

Pre-processing of the spectra is different for each instrumentation and based on relevant literature. After pre-processing the data was modelled using PCA, which is an unsupervised exploratory technique for reducing the dimensionality of the dataset (Geladi and Linderholm, 2020). PCA modelling was performed using the base R *prcomp()* method [@Rteam17].

## Near Infrared
NIRS measures the absorbance of light within the near infrared region (780 nm – 2 500 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum. Based on the theory of molecular vibration and excitation [@hunt77], by exposing a geological material to electromagnetic radiation it is possible to generate overtone vibrations which can be related to certain molecular groups. The most common group capable of generating these overtones is the OH group, which in quartz-based materials typically relates to molecular water [@hunt77 p.508]. 

NIR analysis was conducted with the Analytical Spectral Device (ASD) LabSpec 4, using a contact probe. The ASD features a detection range of 350 – 2500 nm, with spectral sampling (resp. spectral resolution) of 1.4 nm (resp. 3 nm) in the visible and near infrared range and 1.1 nm (resp. 10 nm) in the short‐wave infrared range. Each object was measured against a white reference background and the collected measurements were averaged for each artefact. Two parts of the NIR spectra were analysed separately, the visual region (400 – 750 nm) and the 1 000 – 2 500 nm region. In both analyses the data was mean-centred before PCA modelling.

 \linebreak

## Raman
Raman spectroscopy shares some similarities with NIRS in that they both can be used to infer molecular structure based on their vibrational properties [@nafie01]. However, where NIRS generate overtones of molecular vibration, Raman spectroscopy is based on the *Raman scattering* effect. By exposing a molecule to radiation with a monochromatic laser it is possible to induce a dipole moment in the molecule which generates the Raman effect. The subsequent light that is scattered contains both Rayleigh scatter and Raman scatter, the former at a frequency of incident radiation and the latter at a shifted frequency [@dubessy12]. The spectrometer will measure the Raman scatter and generate a spectrum where the spectral line has shifted compared to the incident Rayleigh frequency. As the structure of a molecule will inform its vibrational mode, the point at which these shifts occur within the infrared region varies depending on the material [@smith_carabatos-nedelec01]. 

The Raman instrumentation used was a portable i-Raman EX featuring a 1064 nm excitation laser. The spectral coverage of the instrumentation is 175 – 2 500 cm-1 ^[Raman shifts are typically given in wavenumber (cm-1), instead of spectral wavelength (nm)] with a resolution of 9.5 cm-1. Access to the spectrometer was made possible by the department of Forest Biomaterials and Technology at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) in Umeå. 

After averaging the spectra for each artefact the results were baseline corrected in order to detrend the data. This was achieved using modified polynomial fitting in R [@Rteam17] with the ChemoSpec package [@hanson16]. The spectra were then mean-centred and normalized using Standard Normal Variate [@shaver01 pp.284-285] before PCA. 

 \linebreak

## X-Ray Fluourescence
XRF measurements were collected using a Thermo Scientific Niton XL5 Analyzer, connected to a Thermo ScientificTM portable test stand. The reference calibration used for element quantification was set to *mining* mode. Sampling with this setting takes 2 minutes in order for the instrument to cycle through all of the filters (main, low, high, light). Due to time constraints and the number of objects in the current dataset it was only possible to collect one measurement on each object, apart from some exceptions. For materials that featured high heterogeneity the sample point was focused, as much as possible, on the surrounding matrix. The XRF data was log-transformed, mean-centered and scaled to unit variance before PCA modelling. As the resulting dataset also features values below the Limit of Detection (LOD), these were treated as NULL, or missing values, during PCA. Since missing values are not permitted during PCA these had to imputed before the analysis, which was performed using the *missMDA* package [@josse_husson16] developed for datasets with incomplete data. Two methods for imputation can be implemented, iterative or regularized, since the former suffers when there are a large number of missing values the latter was chosen.

# Results

## NIR - visual range

The main explanatory power for the visual region can be found in the first component with an explained variance of 98.4 %. In the PCA (fig. \@ref(fig:vis-nir-pca)) there is a clear trend along PC1 with darker materials being grouped together to the right of the plot and light/translucent/white material to the left. Examining the average spectra of these groups (fig. \@ref(fig:vis-nir-spectra)), as expected, the darker material feature higher absorbance of light than the other groups. No other distinctive features can be seen in the visual band, that could potentially be used to distinguish the groups. It is, however, apparent that while the more extreme hues of *dark* and *white* material can be isolated more clearly based on their spectra, there also exists a wider greyscale of material that does not conform as easily to these broader groups. 

A number of artefacts also breaks the observed trend in the PCA, with dark/black (N1-N2) samples ending up closer to the light and translucent group in the PCA. There are also instances where the measurements on different sides of an artefact end up in different groups in the PCA. In examination of the non-averaged data artefact 403 and 502 both have a sample taken on one side in the *dark* group and the other in the *greyish* middle. This is most likely due to the heterogeneous character of the material and natural variations on the surface possibly related to weathering. The *greyish* middle group in the PCA is otherwise largely made up of *quartz coloured* opaque material with a beige/grey tint.

## NIR - near infrared range
No distinct peaks occurred in the 600 – 1 000 nm band, and thus the analysis focused on the 1 000 – 2 500 nm band to lessen the impact of noise. In the case of NIRS similar features can be observed for all four colour groups, with darker materials exhibiting higher absorbance and less defined peaks. The presence of molecular water can be seen in the peaks at 1 400 nm and 1 900 nm  [@hunt77; @sciuto_etal19] (fig. \@ref(fig:nir-spectra)). Peaks also occur at 2 200 nm and 2 350 nm, where the former has been related to combination vibrations of Al-OH and the latter falls within one of the stronger CO^3^ bands [@clark_etal90]. Inspection of individual spectra for the *light* group, however, also reveals a 5th peak for some samples at 2 450 nm. Comparisons to spectra collected on muscovite ([@clark_etal90] p.12 675) shows similar peaks located at 2 200 nm, 2 350 nm, and 2 450 nm. It is therefore possibly that the 2 350 nm band in some cases corresponds to CO^3^ vibrations and in other cases Al-OH. 

The PCA shows a strong trend along PC 1 that seems to correlate with the colour of the material(fig. \@ref(fig:nir-pca)). Darker quartzite cluster to the right with white and translucent samples grouping to the opposite side. While the white samples seem to gravitate to the bottom left of the model the samples that are somewhat translucent, such as the *brecciated quartz*, seem to cluster towards the top-left. A small set of 3 black samples at the top of the model separate themselves clearly from the rest of the data points. These three samples come from different sites and exhibit no distinguishing peaks in their spectra, making them an interesting set of outliers.

## Raman
There are two distinctive features present in the Raman data (fig. \@ref(fig:raman-spectra)). The first can be identified as the *quartz* peak occurring at 460 cm-1 [@gillet_etal90], which is present for all samples in the dataset. The second feature shows up as two peaks occurring at around 1 287 cm-1 and 1 598 cm-1, and dominate the spectra in terms of intensity for the darker samples. These peak positions fall within what is referred to as the *D* and *G* band respectively, and have been observed in spectroscopic studies of graphite/graphene [@cesare_maineri99]. The D band occurs as a result of disordered C structures whilst the G band is indicative of sp^2^ C networks and caused by stretching in the C bonds, which is common in graphite-based materials [@vollebregt_etal12; @lee_etal21]. Whereas the 2^nd^ peak falls within the typical position of the G band, the position of the D band is commonly identified as being 1 330 - 1 350 cm-1. It has, however, been documented that the dispersive behavior of the D band can cause a frequency change as a result of the energy of the incident laser [@pimenta_etal07 p.1280]. This could thus explain the discrepancy between the observed peak in the dataset and the literature.

A third feature, present in a small subset of the samples, appears as two peaks spaced closely together at ca. 695 cm-1 and 795 cm-1. Comparing these to reference samples from the mineral and rock collections kept at the Department of Ecology and Environmental Science at Umeå University, the same peaks are present in measurements collected on, among others, albite, apatite, diabase and shale. Studies of clay minerals [@kloprogge17] have identified a number of band regions in the lower wavenumbers related to Si, Al and OH vibrations, including the 700 - 800 cm-1 band which has been related to Al-O-Si vibrations for the Kaolin group. Considering the petrogenesis of quartzite and the likelihood that clay minerals are present in the material it is possible that this is what generates the feature in the current dataset.

The resulting PCA model (fig. \@ref(fig:raman-pca)) shows a clear trend along PC 1 (81.5 %) related to the quartz and D/G peaks. PC 2 and PC 3, however, mainly describes the remaining noise left in the spectra after preprocessing. Interestingly, PC 4 does catch the Al-O-Si peaks around the  700 cm-1 - 800 cm-1 band, which helps in separating out those samples where this feature is present. The measurements with mainly quartz peaks gravitates towards the positive side of the PC 1, and those where the graphite peaks are dominant towards the opposite side. It is also clear that the darker material feature more pronounced graphite peaks, whereas the lighter and more translucent objects mainly feature quartz peaks. As in the case of the NIR data, however, there are exceptions that break this trend, as well as a “muddled” middle group with both well-pronounced graphite and quartz peaks. When PC 4 is added the samples with quartz and Al-O-Si peaks gravitate towards the bottom left, separating themselves from the *quartz* group.

## XRF
The XRF spectrometer is not capable of detecting all of the common elements, and the software therefore calculates a balance (Bal), which represents the remaining unquantifiable elements in a sample. The elements represented in this unquantifiable group are all those with an atomic number lower than ^12^Mg (REF). Univariate analysis shows that SiO^2^ makes up the main bulk of the composition of the material, and two major groups can be distinguished based on this content (fig. \@ref(fig:xrf-violin-plot)). The majority of the readings resulted in a SiO^2^ content of less than 50%, and about ¼ of the readings (~ 27%) featured a SiO^2^ content closer to 90 %. The “low” SiO^2^ group also feature a Bal between 40 – 70 %. 

The three first components of the PCA have an eigenvalue above 1 and the cumulative explained variance is ~ 84.7%. The loadings of the three components can be seen in figure \@ref(fig:xrf-loadings). In the score plot of PC 1 and PC 2, two large clusters can be seen (fig. \@ref(fig:xrf-score-plot-p1-p2)). Interestingly, the smaller cluster on the left side in the model includes the samples with a SiO^2^ content higher than 50%, whilst the larger cluster includes those with lower SiO^2^ content. It is not ^14^Si that is responsible for this clustering, however, but rather ^26^Fe and ^40^Zr that drives this. The “low ^14^Si” cluster shows a trend along PC 2 of quartzite with a darker hue grouping towards the bottom. This may indicate a possible relation to the ^26^Fe content of the material as ^26^Fe-bearing minerals such as hematite can contribute to the dark colour in quartzite ([@howard05] p.711). The *brecciated quartz* samples largely group together at the top of the “low ^14^Si” cluster, with a couple ending up towards closer to the “high ^14^Si” cluster. The white (N9) material is somewhat evenly distributed within the right cluster. 

The group of measurements that are somewhat separated from the “low ^14^Si” cluster at the bottom are all but one from the rock painting site of *Finnforsberget*, which is located next to the Skellefte river. The *Finnforsberget* artefacts were sampled twice with object 491 having one measurement closer to the “low ^14^Si” group and the other the “high ^14^Si” group with ^13^Al estimated at 25 %. This artefact was sampled twice on each side, resulting in similar results both times.

One almost translucent sample also ends up in the "high ^14^Si" cluster among the darker material. Upon closer inspection this sample is small, ~ 3 by 1 mm, and also feature inclusions of dark particles. Both of these factors may have contributed to its placement in the model.

# Discussion

 \linebreak
 \linebreak

The results demonstrate clearly that all three instrumentations are capable of characterizing some aspect of the quartz and quartzite, however, none of them are capable of providing a detailed fingerprint on their own based solely on surface measurements. Taken together they do provide a more in-depth understanding of the characteristic and structure of the material. The most easily recognizable megascopic feature of the material is its colour, and the results of all three instrumentations demonstrate that there is some truth to this. However, a large group of the material, which features different hues of grey, does not conform as easily. In each of the PCA models there is a *greyish* middle that makes classification difficult.   

Interestingly the ‘brecciated quartz’ remains relatively grouped together in all of the models demonstrating some consistency in the original classification. There are exceptions, however, and it would be advisable to follow up with a more directed analysis focused around this group of material……
