  Northern Fennoscandia represents a geologically complex region with both glacial and postglacial processes having an impact on the archaeology. The widely distributed moraine makes provenience studies difficult, and there is a severe lack of methodological development in the characterization of local geological materials used for tool making. The question is how to approach provenience studies in a region where there is a lack of reference samples as well as documentation of known geological sources. Quartz and quartzite are two central material types utilized among hunter-gatherers in Northern Sweden, and thus important to the understanding of raw material procurement and material flow within the region. A dataset of 445 quartz and quartzite points were analyzed non-destructively with three separate spectroscopic instrumentations, including Near-Infrared, Raman scattering and X-Ray Fluorescence. The aim was to test whether non-destructive application of these spectroscopic techniques can distinguish between different quartz and quartzite types. Multivariate modelling of the spectral data was performed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in which the features observed in the spectra contribute to the clustering within the model. While the results demonstrate that there are a number of structural and compositional differences within the dataset it is difficult to identify any distinct material classes based on any singular technique. The features identified do, however, provide good grounds for survey efforts and the identification of potential geological origin of some of the material. Future efforts will endeavor to model the joint relations between the separate blocks in order to test whether the combined information can aid in discerning different material classes.

# Introduction

Petrographic characterization and provenance studies are instrumental in the modelling and inference of trade and exchange networks among prehistoric societies (REF). The presence of lithic material foreign to the local region naturally raises important questions regarding the processes that resulted in its eventual deposition and discovery. Although the petrographic characterization of the material mainly establishes a point of geological origin for the object it is still an important first step in reconstructing the *chaîne opératoire*. Flint and obsidian have both been central to the study of trade and exhange networks in European prehistory, due in part to the well-surveyed geological sources for these. The last decades, however, have seen an increase in the interest for non-flint lithics and raw material studies [@blomme_etal12; @dalpra_pitblado16; @prieto_etal19; @prieto_etal20; @prieto_etal21; @ramacciotti_etal19]. Prieto et al. [-@prieto_etal19 p. 15] highlights the current bias that exists in the understanding of raw material management in regions where the local flint and obsidian sources are non-existent^[This is not to say that flint was not available or used in these regions]. In northern Sweden both quartz and quartzite are instrumental in the inference of settlement and mobility within the region. While quartz and quartzite technology have been the target of a number of studies over the years, there have been less development in the petrographic characterization and provenience studies of these same materials [@broadbent79; @callahan_etal92; @knutsson_etal16; @tallavaara_etal10]. Although flint and slate have featured in discussions of trade and exchange [@halen94 pp. 115-122; @lundberg97 pp. 161-171] within the regon, another reason for the lack of methodological development in North Swedish research could be the complex geological background of the region [@bargel03; @stephens_bergmanweihed20; @stroeven_etal16]. The abundance of moraine formations and the degree to which geological materials have been mixed and transported necessitates considerable effort in order to reconstruct the events that have formed the modern day landscape. The tentative interpretations of lithic material sourcing within northern Sweden tends to describe strategies leaning towards direct procurement from the mountain zone [@forsberg85; -@forsberg12]. This does not account for the possibility that the material sourced locally from exposed veins in the bedrock, or as loose rocks and pebbles in the numerous moraine formations, as part of a strategy leaning more towards an embedded adaptation [@binford79; @rankama_etal06 pp.249-250]. Due to this ambiguous nature of availability of raw materials provenience studies are complex and fraught with uncertainty. 



Prieto et al. [-@prieto_etal19 p.15; -@prieto_etal20 p.32] notes that the usage of the term *quartzite* in archaeology has been somewhat ambiguous, often used interchangeably between sedimentary orthoquartzite and metamorphic quartzite. It is difficult to provide a comprehensive definition of quartzite, owing much to its metamorphic nature, and different researchers have thus emphasized different features as being characteristic of the material [@howard05]. Visual characterization on a megascopic level is typically unreliable, and microscopic analysis is recommended for the identification of metamorphic structures, but Howard [-@howard05 p.708] also emphasises the need for field-based methodologies. In the case of archaeological research it is worth considering situations where destructive techniques simply are not applicable. Artefact collections (museum, private, etc.) represent a valuable resource and asset, with easy access to large datasets with a wide geographical distribution. While destructive methods may prohibit access to such material there are still non-destructive alternatives that can generate valuable information. Aside from being non-destructive spectroscopic instrumentations feature fast measurements, making it an attractive option for field-based screening purposes. While X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) is the go-to spectroscopic technique for petrographic characterization [@shackley11a; @tykot03], due to its capability of providing compositional data, there are other instrumentations that may provide a deeper insight into the structural properties. The use of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) goes almost as far back as the XRF [@hunt77], and there is an impressive body of work dedicated to the fingerprinting of geological materials [@linderholm_geladi14a; @linderholm_geladi14b; @sciuto19]. The same can be said for Raman spectroscopy, which has been applied extensively in the Cultural Heritage sector and in the analysis of artwork and manuscripts [@vandenabeele12].

## Aims

In the current study a dataset of quartz and quartzite artefacts from museum collections in Västerbotten, Sweden, have been analysed using the three above mentioned spectroscopic instrumentations (NIRS, Raman and XRF). The aim is to evaluate their viability for non-destructive fingerprinting of quartz and quartzite material in the North Swedish region. The study is a part of a larger project wherein models of settlement and mobility are being evaluated and developed in regards to raw material procurement and use. In contrast to non-local material such as flint, determining the degree to which cultural and/or environmental factors have influenced the distribution pattern of quartz and quartzite artefacts is difficult. While there is a good understanding of the geological makeup of the Scandes [@stephens_bergmanweihed20], the quartzite itself remains largely uncharacterized, with few reference samples available for spectral comparison. The glacial impact on the landscape further compounds the issue as geological material has been transported and deposited by glacial movements, as well as subsequent postglacial processes. Although models for settlement and mobility can be used to test ideas of material distribution as influenced by cultural processes [e.g. @forsberg85], it is also necessary to attempt to estimate the degree of environmental impact on this pattern.

In order to engage in any meaningful analysis of the above settlement pattern, however, it is first necessary to distinguish between different quartz and quartzite groups. In doing so the distribution of different material groups can be spatially analyzed, and the above models for settlement and mobility tested. In this study Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used in order to group the materials according to their spectral features and their contributions to the Principal Components (PC) [@geladi_linderholm20]. Any clustering or trends observed in the PCA should relate to the chemical characteristic of the material, and thus potentially similar geological origin. The results form the basis of a discussion of the viability of using non-destructive spectroscopy in petrographic characterization of quartz and quartzite material, and thus future efforts in the development of models for raw material sourcing in Northern Sweden.

The current study is based on spectroscopic surface measurements collected on quartz and quartzite points recovered from sites along the river of Ångermanälven, Västerbotten County, Sweden. The study area ranges from the lake of Kultsjön in the southwest of the County to the town of Åsele in the southeast. A dataset of `r length(tot_uniq)` points, point fragments and preforms stored at the collections at Västerbotten museum (www.vbm.se) have been analysed using NIRS, Raman scattering and XRF. The material features a mainly black or gray hue, as well as a subset of semi-translucent material with a beige tint to almost fully translucent. The colour of the material has been classified both according to the Munsell system, as well as sorted into general categories of hue for visualization purposes: *dark* (~ N1-N4), *light* (~ N5-N8), *white* (~ N9), *colourless* (lack of colour, opaque to translucent). A number of these points have, according to prior classifications, been worked using bifacial technology. While there currently is no local chronology available for this artefact type in the North Swedish region^[For comparison, Mjæreum -@mjaerum12 has put forth a chronology for bifacial points in southwestern Norway], there have been attempts [@baudou92 p.99; @forsberg85 p.5; @forsberg89]. Previous research suggests a period of use that falls between ca. 3 800 - 2 000 BP [@kaeck09 p.60]. Similarly, studies of raw material use at sites dating to this period seems to indicate an increase in the use of quartzite [@baudou78]. 

A large portion of the collections stored at North Swedish museums were recovered from excavations and surveys performed in conjunction with the river regulations during the 1940s – 1980s [@biornstad06; @janson_hvarfner60], as well as subsequent follow-up survey projects [e.g. @andersson15]. Vilhelmina parish in particular has been the target for numerous excavations and survey projects during this period.

The dataset includes three main types of registered petrographic material: quartz, quartzite, and brecciated quartz (Swe. "*brecciekvarts*"). Those that had no prior classification available were sorted into either the quartz or quartzite category.This distribution of samples into these categories are as follows: `r length(bquartz)` brecciated quartz, `r length(quartz)` quartz, and `r length(quartzite)` quartzite samples. The inclusion of quartz and brecciated quartz in the study serves two purposes. The first being to test the potential for separating the material types based on their chemical and structural characteristic, and the second related purpose is to account for potential mistakes in the original classification. In his study of the lithic material from the *Early Norrland* project [@biornstad68; @ahman67], the geologist Åhman [-@ahman67 p.8] analysed artefacts from sites located along the Ume river valley. He briefly touches upon the definition of *brecciated quartz* (also referred to as *mylonite quartz*) and describes the material as having formed from a quartz vein which has fractured and then recrystallized via pressure. While the translucent material may give the impression of an unusually pure quartzite, Åhman states that the thin-section analysis reveals the fragmented configuration of quartz. *Brecciated quartz* in particular is a somewhat common term used in North Swedish archaeology, and has typically been used to identify a certain translucent type of fine-grained, quartz-rich material [e.g. @holm91 p.24]. As the material frequently has been characterized based on megascopic characteristics, despite the central features necessary for characterization being microscopic, there is value in including a test group in the study.

# Methods

 \linebreak
 \linebreak

All measurements were performed at the Environmental Archaeology Lab at Umeå University^[www.umu.se/en/research/infrastructure/mal/]. The analysis was conducted in a dark room in order to minimize light pollution, with the main light sources in the room being the computer screens. Each artefact was sampled twice, on different sides, with additional measurements in cases where sampling was difficult. The only exception to this was the XRF, where due to time constraints one measurement was collected as a rule apart from a few exceptions. This lowers the statistical reliability of the XRF analysis and inferences of the results should be evaluated with this in mind. The size of the dataset alleviates some of these issues, as for the larger sites there are multiple objects that may be of the same material, however, for the smaller sites there still remains some uncertainties. For materials that featured high heterogeneity the sample point was focused, as much as possible, on the surrounding matrix.   

Pre-processing of the spectra is different for each instrumentation and based on relevant literature. After pre-processing the data was modelled using PCA, which is an unsupervised exploratory technique for reducing the dimensionality of the dataset [@geladi_linderholm20]. PCA has proven useful for exploring complex spectroscopic datasets [@sciuto19], and identifying clusters and trends that relate to the spectral fingerprints of the material. These groupings can then be tested with supervised methods, and in the construction of classification models. Multivariate analysis methods, such as PCA, are also useful for overcoming some of the issues related to so-called "data closure" [@reimann_etal12]. The compositional data add up to a constant (100%), which is described as the *closed sum* effect. Correlation analysis is directly affected by this *closure* effect and therefore not suitable. With suitable preprocessing the PCA model can reveal the structure and relations between the variables (elements) more accurately. PCA modelling in this case was performed using the base R *prcomp()* function [@Rteam17; @rcoreteam21].

## Near Infrared
NIRS measures the absorbance of light within the near infrared region (780 nm – 2 500 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum. Based on the theory of molecular vibration and excitation [@hunt77], by exposing a geological material to electromagnetic radiation it is possible to generate overtone vibrations which can be related to certain molecular groups. The most common group capable of generating these overtones is the OH group, which in quartz-based materials typically relates to molecular water [@hunt77 p.508]. 

NIR analysis was conducted with the Analytical Spectral Device (ASD) LabSpec 4, using a contact probe. The ASD features a detection range of 350 nm – 2 500 nm, with spectral sampling (resp. spectral resolution) of 1.4 nm (resp. 3 nm) in the visible and near infrared range and 1.1 nm (resp. 10 nm) in the short‐wave infrared range. Each object was measured against a white reference background and the collected measurements were averaged for each artefact. The visible spectrum (~ 400 nm - 750 nm) and the NIR range (~ 1 000 nm – 2 500 nm) were analysed separately, with the former focused on colour analysis and the latter the chemical structure of the material. The data was mean-centred before PCA modelling. 

 \linebreak

## Raman
Raman spectroscopy shares some similarities with NIRS in that they both can be used to infer molecular structure based on their vibrational properties [@nafie01]. However, where NIRS measures light absorbance and generate overtones of molecular vibration, Raman spectroscopy is based on the *Raman scattering* effect. By exposing a molecule to radiation with a monochromatic laser it is possible to induce a dipole moment in the molecule which generates the Raman effect. The subsequent light that is scattered contains both Rayleigh scatter and Raman scatter, the former at a frequency of incident radiation and the latter at a shifted frequency [@dubessy12]. The spectrometer will measure the Raman scatter and generate a spectrum where the spectral line has shifted compared to the incident Rayleigh frequency. As the structure of a molecule will inform its vibrational mode, the point at which these shifts occur within the infrared region varies depending on the material [@smith_carabatos-nedelec01]. 

The Raman instrumentation used was a portable i-Raman EX featuring a 1064 nm excitation laser. The spectral coverage of the instrumentation is 175 cm^-1^ – 2 500 cm^-1^ ^[Raman shifts are typically given in wavenumber (cm^-1^), instead of spectral wavelength (nm)] with a resolution of 9.5 cm^-1^. Access to the spectrometer was made possible by the department of Forest Biomaterials and Technology at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) in Umeå^[www.slu.se/en/departments/forest-biomaterials-technology/]. 

After averaging the spectra for each artefact the results were baseline corrected in order to detrend the data. This was achieved using modified polynomial fitting in R [@Rteam17] with the ChemoSpec package [@hanson16]. The spectra were then mean-centred and normalized using Standard Normal Variate [@shaver01 pp.284-285] before PCA. 

 \linebreak

## X-Ray Fluourescence
XRF spectroscopy, and its capabilities for quantifying chemical elements in different materials, has made it a well-established method for petrographic analysis in archaeology [@hall60; @shackley11a]. Exposing a material to X-ray radiation causes electrons to dislodge and move between the electron shells of the atoms, which in turn emits energy (i.e. *fluourescence*). As the energy differences between electron shells for the various elements is known it is possible to both identify and quantify the abundance of an element [@shackley11b p.16], which is useful for provenience studies where the chemical character of an unknown and a reference sample can tested statistically [@tykot03].  

XRF measurements were collected using a Thermo Scientific Niton XL5 Analyzer, connected to a portable test stand. The reference calibration used for element quantification was set to *mining* mode. Sampling with this setting takes 2 minutes in order for the instrument to cycle through all of the filters (main, low, high, light). Due to time constraints and the number of objects in the current dataset it was only possible to collect one measurement on each object, apart from some exceptions.

The XRF data was log-transformed, mean-centered and scaled to unit variance before PCA modelling. As the resulting dataset also features values below the Limit of Detection (LOD) these were treated as NULL (or "missing values") during PCA. A LOD value is defined as a measured value 3 times lower than the standard deviation for that measurement. Since missing values are not permitted during PCA these had to be imputed before the analysis, which was performed using the *missMDA* R package [@josse_husson16] developed for datasets with incomplete data. Two methods for imputation can be implemented, iterative or regularized, and since the former suffers when there is a large number of missing values the latter was used.

It is well-known that NIRS is less effective on translucent material, such as a pure quartz crystal, as the abscence of impurities in the material will result in little to no reflection/absorbance of light [@hunt77]. Similarly it can be difficult to work with dark materials as most of the light will be absorbed, thus obscuring any potential spectral features. This effect can be seen in figure \@ref(fig:nir-spectra-summary) which shows a summary of the centered NIR spectra by color group. The dark group generally features less distinct peaks than the material with a lighter hue. This is not to say that all spectra collected on dark quartzite features less information, but any model including them will affect the clustering of the dataset as a whole. Filtering out those spectra that feature no peaks or mainly noise leaves `r length(spec.d)` samples in the dark group. Excluding the noisier spectra, and those with no discernable peaks, there is still a noticeable difference between the dark and light group. By applying 2^nd^ derivative Savitszky-Golay transformation on the dark spectra broad spectral features can be filtered out [@chryssikos_gates pp.78-81]. Comparing the centered spectra to the derivative it becomes clear that there are significant peaks that may be of relevance to the characterization of the material (fig. \@ref(fig:nir-savitzky-transform)).

The most common features in quartz-based material are two peaks located at 1 400 nm and 1 900 nm (fig. XX), indicating the presence of molecular water [@hunt77; @sciuto_etal19]. Apart from these the main features can be found in  the > 2 000 nm range. Hydroxyl (OH) groups can produce a response in a number of different fields in the same material, and largely depend on the element they are attached to [@hunt77 pp. 509-510]. In a large group of the samples these peaks occur at 2 200 nm and 2 350 nm, with the former often being the more intense of the two. A general rule has been that aluminium (Al) contributes to a more intense peak at 2 200 nm, and magnesium (Mg) at 2 300 nm [@hunt77 p.509]. While this often may be the case there are also exceptions to this rule, and it should thus not be considered a definitive answer [@clark_etal90 p.12664]. These absorption bands can be found in minerals like muscovite, which would not be strange to find in quartzite [@clark_etal90 p.12; hunt77 p.510; @ramanaidou15 p.207]. The 2 350 nm band is also one of the stronger carbonate (CO) bands, but considering that the 2 350 nm peak always is accompanied by the 2 200 nm peak it would be unlikely to be related to CO stretching.

The PCA shows a strong trend along PC 1 ( %) that seems to correlate with the colour of the material(fig. \@ref(fig:nir-pca)). Darker quartzite cluster to the right with white and colourless samples grouping to the opposite side. While the white samples seem to gravitate to the bottom left of the model the samples that are somewhat translucent, such as the brecciated quartz, seem to cluster towards the top-left. At the top of the score plot 3 black samples separate themselves clearly from the rest of the data points. These three samples come from different sites and exhibit no peaks in their spectra, making them an interesting set of outliers.

## Raman
There are two distinguishing features present in the Raman data (fig. \@ref(fig:raman-spectra)). The first are three peaks in the 100 cm^-1^ - 500 cm^-1^ band that are typical for SiO~2~ and quartz-based materials, with the strongest peak occuring at 460 cm^-1^ [@gillet_etal90]. These peaks are present for all samples in the dataset. The second feature shows up as two peaks occurring at around 1 287 cm^-1^ and 1 598 cm^-1^, and dominate the spectra in terms of intensity for the darker samples. These peak positions fall within what is referred to as the *D* and *G* band respectively, and have been observed in spectroscopic studies of graphite [@cesare_maineri99]. The D band occurs as a result of disordered carbon (C) structures whilst the G band is indicative of sp^2^ carbon networks and caused by stretching in the carbon bonds, which is common in graphite-based materials [@cohen-ofri_etal06; @vollebregt_etal12; @lee_etal21]. Whereas the 2^nd^ peak falls within the typical position of the G band, the position of the D band is commonly identified as being in the 1 330 - 1 350 cm^-1^ region. It has, however, been documented that the dispersive behavior of the D band can cause a frequency change as a result of the energy of the incident laser [@pimenta_etal07 p.1280]. This could thus explain the discrepancy between the observed peak in the dataset and the literature.

A third feature, present in a small subset of the samples, appears as two peaks spaced closely together at ~ 695 cm^-1^ and 795 cm^-1^. Studies of clay minerals [@kloprogge17] have identified a number of band regions in the lower wavenumbers related to Si, Al and OH vibrations, including the 700 - 800 cm^-1^ band. Considering the petrogenesis of quartzite and the likelihood that clay minerals are present in the material it is possible that this is what generates the feature in the current dataset, although measurements on iron ore minerals have also generated a response in the 600 - 700 cm^-1^ band region [@ramanaidou15].

The resulting PCA model (fig. \@ref(fig:raman-pca)) shows a clear trend along PC 1 ( %) related to the quartz and D - G peaks. PC 2 and PC 3, however, mainly describes the remaining noise left in the spectra after detrending and preprocessing the data. Interestingly, the loading for PC 3 does include the Al-O-Si peaks around the 700 cm^-1^ - 800 cm^-1^ band, which helps in separating out those samples where this feature is present. The measurements with mainly quartz peaks gravitates towards the negative side of PC 1, and those where the graphite peaks are dominant towards the opposite side. It is also clear that the darker material feature more pronounced graphite peaks, whereas the lighter and more colourless objects mainly feature quartz peaks. As in the case of the NIR data, however, there are exceptions that break this trend, as well as a “muddled” middle group with both well-pronounced graphite and quartz peaks. When PC 3 ( %) is added the samples with quartz and Al-O-Si peaks gravitate towards the bottom left, separating themselves from the "quarts" group.

## XRF
Four samples had dimensions that were < 10 mm in size of their smallest dimension, and were therefore excluded from the analysis as there may be complications when comparing these to larger samples [@shackley11b pp.9-10]. The XRF spectrometer is not capable of detecting all of the common elements, and the software therefore calculates a balance (Bal) that represents the remaining unquantifiable elements in a sample. The elements represented in this unquantifiable group are all those with an atomic number lower than ^12^Mg (REF). Univariate analysis shows that ^14^Si makes up the main bulk of the composition of the material, with a bimodal distribution (fig. \@ref(fig:xrf-violin-plot)). The majority of the readings resulted in a ^14^Si content of less than 50%, and about ¼ of the readings (~ %) featured a ^14^Si content closer to 90%. The “low” ^14^Si group also feature a Bal between 40 – 70%. 

The two first components of the PCA have an eigenvalue above 1 and the cumulative explained variance is ~ %. The loadings can be be seen in figure \@ref(fig:xrf-loadings). In the score plot of PC 1 and PC 2 two large clusters can be seen (fig. \@ref(fig:xrf-score-plot)). The smaller cluster on the left side in the score plot includes the samples with a ^14^Si content higher than 50%, whilst the larger cluster includes those with lower ^14^Si content. It does not seem to be ^14^Si that is responsible for this clustering, however, but rather ^26^Fe and ^40^Zr that are the main contributors. The “low ^14^Si” cluster shows a trend along PC 2 of quartzite with a darker hue grouping towards the bottom. This may indicate a possible relation to the ^26^Fe content of the material as ^26^Fe-bearing minerals such as hematite can contribute to the dark colour in quartzite [@howard05 p.711]. The brecciated quartz samples largely group together at the top of the “low ^14^Si” cluster, with a couple ending up closer towards the “high ^14^Si” cluster. The white (N9) material is fairly evenly distributed within the right cluster. 

The group of measurements that are somewhat separated from the “low ^14^Si” cluster at the bottom are all but one from the rock painting site of *Finnforsberget*, which is located next to the Skellefte river. The *Finnforsberget* artefacts were sampled twice with object 491 having one measurement closer to the “low ^14^Si” group and the other the “high ^14^Si” group with ^13^Al estimated at 25%. This artefact was sampled twice on each side, resulting in similar results both times.

# Discussion

 \linebreak
 \linebreak

The most easily recognizable megascopic feature of petrographic material is its color, which has been the main attribute used for grouping quartzite in North Swedish archaeological research [e.g. @forsberg85 pp.60–64; @kaeck09 pp.53–55]. While it is true that some inference of elemental content can be made based on color this is significantly more difficult with heterogeneous material such as quartzite. Indeed, destructive techniques are typically necessary in order to document the various metamorphic features characteristic of quartzite [@howard05; @prieto_etal19]. Non-destructive application of the above spectroscopic techniques does, however, bring to light some interesting characteristics of the material. Although there are trends that align with the perceived color of the objects in the PCA there are also exceptions to this rule, as well as a “muddled” grey zone of material that does not conform to the light and dark extremes. It is also worth mentioning that the color classification does not take the heterogeneous nature of the material into consideration.  

Although no distinct enough groupings were observed as to make classification possible, a number of structural and chemical characteristics were identified. Despite the Raman PCA lacking descriptive power, due to the few features observed in the spectra, the presence of the “graphite peaks” may present an important piece of information in the identification of the potential geological origin of the material. Interestingly, mentions of graphitic quartzite can be found in an early 20th century description of an excursion to Storfjället, Tärna parish, by the Geological Society [@geologiska25], but otherwise does not seem to be a frequently used term in the modern day. Naturally, identifying the geological origin does not necessitate a direct link between that point and the procurement of the material, and further studies would be necessary in order to infer resource management strategies from this evidence. 

The exploratory approach presented in this paper holds potential for enabling provenance studies within geologically complex regions. Screening a large enough dataset makes it possible to look at in-group variations and isolate spectroscopic distinct fingerprints [e.g. @sciuto_etal19]. These can then be used as the basis for later classification of the material into structurally different groups. The characterization of quartz and quartzite is fundamental if questions of resource procurement, trade and exchange and human mobility are to be developed within Northern Sweden. Being able to distinguish between different types of quartz and quartzite would enable the spatial analysis and modelling of distribution patterns, regardless of whether the geological source is known or not. In the current case study modelling the results of single instrumentation may have been limited for the purpose of classification, but modelling the joint relations between the separate data blocks may provide further aid in isolating distinct types of quartz and quartzite.

# Conclusion

The results demonstrate clearly that non-destructive application of all three instrumentations (NIRS, Raman, XRF) are capable of petrographically characterizing some aspect of the quartz and quartzite, however, taken on their own they lack the resolution needed to provide a detailed enough fingerprint for classification. Nevertheless, they do provide a more in-depth understanding of the composition and structure of the material, as well as showcase the complexity in the petrographic character of quartz and quartzite materials. The study represents a good example of a multivariate exploratory approach to the characterization of petrographic material where there also is an absence of reference material. There is a need for methodologies that can be applied in regions with a complex geological setting and ambiguous distribution of potential geological sources. Taking full advantage of the short integration time of these instruments it is possible to build large comprehensive datasets that then can be explored and mined using multivariate models.
